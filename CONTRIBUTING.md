# Read this before you start making PRs

I've opened this up for #Hacktoberfest if anyone is looking

## What I need
* Add more functionality to it
* Make it more readable (YES, you can add and remove whitespaces. But that does not mean you can do that and make a PR)
* Solely whitespace edited commits will be rejected
* When I say make it readable, I mean comment it in simple english so that even a puppy can read it.
* Make it more efficient
* No John, I don't want to make a bot that can sing songs from youtube
* We already have Rhythm and another bazillion other bot that can do that, stick to it.
* I made this because Rickbot didn't work. So, yeah, this is for playing local music files.
* KEEP IT THAT WAY.
